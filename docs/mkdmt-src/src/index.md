# r2u: CRAN as Ubuntu Binaries

### Key features

- **Full integration with `apt`** as every binary resolves _all_ its dependencies: No more
  installations (of pre-built archives) only to discover that a shared library is missing. No more
  surprises.

- **Full integration with `apt`** so that an update of a system library
  cannot break an R package: if a (shared) library is used by a CRAN, the
  package manager knows and will not remove it.  No more (R package) breakage
  from (system) library updates.

- **Installations are fast, automated and reversible** thanks to package
  management layer.

- **Fast and well-connected mirror** at
  [r2u.stat.illinois.edu](https://r2u.stat.illinois.edu) on the [Internet2](https://internet2.edu/) 

- **Complete coverage** with (currently) ~ 20,000 CRAN packages
  (and 240+ from BioConductor).

- Complete support for both **Ubuntu 20.04** ("focal") **and Ubuntu 22.04** ("jammy").

- Optional (but recommended) [bspm](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=bspm) use
  **automagically connects R functions like `install.packages()` to `apt`** for access to binaries 
  _and_ dependencies.


### Brief Demo

The gif below shows how _one `install.packages("tidyverse")` command_ on an Ubuntu
20.04 system _installs all packages and dependencies as binaries in 18 seconds_ (by passing the
R package installation to `apt` using [bspm](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=bspm)).

This uses the Docker container referenced below, which has been set up with
the five easy setup steps detailed here.


### What is Covered ?

We generally support amd64 (_i.e._ standard Intel/AMD cpus) for the Ubuntu LTS release and the
predecessor release.  We use 'r-release' just like CRAN. So currently the 'focal' 20.04 LTS and
'jammy' 22.04 LTS releases are fully supported.

Support for other cpu architectures is certainly possible but somewhat unlikely due to a lack of
(additional hardware) resources and time. Support for other distributions is possible but unlikely
right now (due to a lack of resources and time). We hope to cover Debian at some point.

Current versions are R 4.2.2, and BioConductor release 3.16 packages are provided when required by
CRAN packages.


### What is Selected ?

Everything :)

Initially, we started from [cran-logs](https://cran-logs.rstudio.com/) by picking the _N_
most-downloaded packages, along with their dependencies from BioConductor.  (It should be noted that
for example the first 100 packages already account for approximately half the total downloads: it is
a very skewed distribution.) We iterated, and fairly soon arrived of full coverage of CRAN.

So we now cover

- *all CRAN packages* (modulo at best handful of blacklisted ones) including all packages needing
  compilation
- all BioConductor package that are implied by these (and build for us).

This currently resuls in 20410 and 20308 binary packages from CRAN in "focal" and "jammy",
respectively, and 249 and 245 BioConductor packages, respectively, from the 3.16 release.

The sole exception are a two packages we cannot build (as we do not have the required commercial
software it accessess) plus less than a handful of 'odd builds' that fail and
are skipped.

### What is it Based On?

For the CRAN binaries we either repackage RSPM builds (where available) or build natively. All
selected BioConductor 3.16 packages are built natively.  For all of these, full dependency
resolution and integration with the system is a key feature.

Everything is provided as `.deb` binary files with proper dependency
resolution by using a proper `apt` repo which also has a signed Release file.


### Usage and Setup

(Note that you could use [this script
`add_cranapt_focal.sh`](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u/blob/master/inst/scripts/add_cranapt_focal.sh)
or the [variant for
jammy](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u/blob/master/inst/scripts/add_cranapt_jammy.sh)
to facilitate the setup but you may prefer to execute the steps outlined here
by hand.)

First add the repository key so that `apt` knows it (this is optional but recommended)

    apt install --yes --no-install-recommends wget  	# to add the key
    wget -q -O- https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/assets/dirk_eddelbuettel_key.asc \
        | tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cranapt_key.asc

Second, add the repository to the `apt` registry. You can use the original host

    echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranapt focal main" \
        > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cranapt.list
    apt update

_or_ use the mirror at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/):

    echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://r2u.stat.illinois.edu/ubuntu focal main" \
        > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cranapt.list
    apt update

(In either example, replace `focal` with `jammy` for use with Ubuntu 22.04.)

Third, and optionally, if you do not yet have the current R version, run these two lines (or
use the [standard CRAN repo setup](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/))

    wget -q -O- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc \
        | tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc
    echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu focal-cran40/" \
        > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cran-ubuntu.list

(Again, replace `focal` with `jammy` for use with Ubuntu 22.04.)

Fourth, add repository 'pinning' as `apt` might get confused by some older
packages (in the Ubuntu distro) which accidentally appear with a higher
version number. See the next section to ensure 'CRANapt' sorts highest.

After that the package are known (under their `r-cran-*` and `r-bioc-*`
names).  You can install them on the command-line using `apt` and `apt-get`,
via `aptitude` as well as other front-ends.

Fifth, and also optional, install and enable the
[bspm](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=bspm) package so that CRANapt and
other packages become available via `install.packages()` and
`update.packages()`. Note that you may need to install it directly from source via `sudo Rscript -e
'install.packages("bspm")'` to ensure it integrates correctly with the packaging system.
You should also install Python components used internally by
[bspm](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=bspm) via the `sudo apt-get install 
python3-{dbus,gi,apt}` command.

### Pinning

Because we let `apt` (and related tools) pick the packages, we have to ensure
that the CRANapt repo sorts higher than the default repo as (older)
package builds in the distribution itself may appear (to `apt`) to be
newer. A case in point was package `gtable` whose version in Ubuntu was
`0.3.0+dfsg-1` which accidentally sorts higher than the rebuild we made under
a newer and more consistent version number `0.3.0-1.ca2004.1`.  One possible
fix is 'apt pinning'. Place a file `/etc/apt/preferences.d/99cranapt` with content

    Package: *
    Pin: release o=CRAN-Apt Project
    Pin: release l=CRAN-Apt Packages
    Pin-Priority: 700

which will now give packages from this repo a higher default priority of 700
overriding the standard value of 500.


### Docker

There are also two Docker containers for Ubuntu 20.04 'focal' and 22.04 'jammy', respectively, at
[eddelbuettel/r2u](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eddelbuettel/r2u) that have the above,
including pinning and [bspm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bspm) support, already set up.

Note that with recent builds of Docker (and possibly related to Ubuntu hosts) you may have to add
the `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` option to your Docker invocation to take advantage of bspm
and the full system integration inside the container.
This is also documented in the [FAQ](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/vignettes/FAQ/).

We also found that when building containers based off the `r2u` containers, we could not rely on the
nice `bspm` integration as it requires superuser rights to pass off commands from `install.packages()` to `apt`. 
You can still use `r2u` containers as a base, but sadly have to turn off `bspm` and use just `apt`
commands to install packages.


### Try It

Use this link below (after possibly signing up for
[gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/) first)

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u)

and run [one of the three example
scripts](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u/tree/master/inst/examples), or
just start R in the terminal window.

The gif below display running one such example to install
[brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) from binaries in a few seconds.  Using this requires
only (free) [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitPod](https://gitpod.io) accounts.


### Support

Please file issues at the [GitHub issues for r2u](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u/issues).


### Known Issues

- The littler package reflects build-time configuration, the RSPM binary is then expecting a
  different R location so it needs a binary rebuild. Added a 'force' flag, may need a list similar
  to the blacklist to always compiled.

- A small number of packages do not build for lack required components; examples are ROracle and
  Rcplex.  They, and their reverse dependencies, are are blacklisted and not built.

- r2u is an `apt` repo, which via `bspm` becomes used "automagically" via standard R calls of
  `install.packages()` and alike. That last part is important: package installations that do not use
  `install.packages()` (such as `renv`, `rig`, ...) do not benefit from
  `install.packages()` calling `apt` for you, and cannot take advantage of r2u via `bspm`.
 
 - `bspm` traces calls to `install.packages()` and maps them system-wide installation via `apt`.  By
   choice, it does not map the `remove.packages()` for package removal, see [this
   issue](https://github.com/Enchufa2/bspm/issues/43) for more discussion. Packages can be uninstalled
   via the system package manager using, respectively, `apt`, `dpkg` or one of graphical frontends as
   well as via the R function `bspm::remove_sys()`.

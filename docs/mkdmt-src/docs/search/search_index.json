No more surprises. Full integration with apt so that an update of a system library cannot break an R package: if a (shared) library is used by a CRAN, the package manager knows, and will not remove it. No more (R package) breakage from (system) library updates. Simpler and lighter than some alternatives as only run-time library packages are installed as dependencies (instead of generally heavier development packages). Installations are fast, automated and reversible thanks to the package management layer. Fast and well-connected mirror at r2u.stat.illinois.edu on the Internet2 Complete coverage with (currently) ~ 20,000 CRAN packages (and 240+ from BioConductor). Complete support for both Ubuntu 20.04 (\"focal\") and Ubuntu 22.04 (\"jammy\"). Optional (but recommended) bspm use automagically connects R functions like install.packages() to apt for access to binaries and dependencies. Brief Demo The gif below shows how one install.packages(\"tidyverse\") command on an Ubuntu 20.04 system installs all packages and dependencies as binaries in 18 seconds (by passing the R package installation to apt using bspm ). This uses the Docker container referenced below, which has been set up with the five easy setup steps detailed here. What is Covered ? We generally support amd64 ( i.e. standard Intel/AMD cpus) for the current Ubuntu LTS release and its predecessor release. We use 'r-release' just like CRAN. So currently the 'focal' 20.04 LTS and 'jammy' 22.04 LTS releases are fully supported. Support for other cpu architectures is certainly possible but somewhat unlikely due to a lack of (additional hardware) resources and time. Support for other distributions is possible but unlikely right now (due to a lack of resources and time). We still hope to cover Debian at some point. Current versions are R 4.2.2, and BioConductor release 3.16 packages are provided when required by CRAN packages. What is Selected ? Everything :) Initially, we started from cran-logs by picking the N most-downloaded packages, along with their dependencies from BioConductor. (It should be noted that for example the first 100 packages already account for approximately half the total downloads: it is a very skewed distribution.) We iterated, and fairly soon arrived of full coverage of CRAN. So we now cover all CRAN packages (modulo at best handful of blacklisted ones) including all packages needing compilation all BioConductor package that are implied by these (and build for us). This currently resuls in 20727 and 20627 binary packages from CRAN in \"focal\" and \"jammy\", respectively, and 249 and 245 BioConductor packages, respectively, from the 3.16 release. The sole exception are two packages we cannot build (as we do not have the required commercial software it accessess) plus less than a handful of 'odd builds' that fail and are skipped. What is it Based On? For the CRAN binaries we either repackage RSPM/PPM builds (where available) or build natively. All selected BioConductor 3.16 packages are built natively. For all of these, full dependency resolution and integration with the system is a key feature. Everything is provided as .deb binary files with proper dependency resolution by using a proper apt repo which also has a signed Release file. Usage and Setup (Note that you could use one of the two scripts add_cranapt_jammy.sh (for Ubuntu 22.04), or add_cranapt_focal.sh (for the older Ubuntu 20.04) to facilitate the setup. They are tested on 'empty' Ubuntu containers of the corresponding release. However, you may prefer to execute the steps outlined here by hand.) We show the setup step by step for 'jammy' aka Ubuntu 22.04. You should run all these commands as root to carefully review each one. Step 1: Update apt, install tools, fetch key First add the repository key so that apt knows it (this is optional but recommended) apt update -qq && apt install --yes --no-install-recommends wget ca-certificates gnupg wget -q -O- https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/assets/dirk_eddelbuettel_key.asc \\ | tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cranapt_key.asc Step 2: Add the apt repo Second, add the repository to the apt registry. We recommend the well-connected main mirror provide at University of Illinois: echo \"deb [arch=amd64] https://r2u.stat.illinois.edu/ubuntu jammy main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cranapt.list apt update -qq Step 3: Ensure you have current R binaries (optional) Third, and optionally, if you do not yet have the current R version, run these two lines (or use the standard CRAN repo setup ) wget -q -O- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc \\ | tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc echo \"deb [arch=amd64] https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu jammy-cran40/\" > /etc/apt/ sources.list.d/cran_r.list apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 67C2D66C4B1D4339 51716619E084DAB9 apt update -qq DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install --yes --no-install-recommends r-base-core Step 4: Use pinning for the r2u repo (optional) Fourth, add repository 'pinning' as apt might get confused by some older packages (in the Ubuntu distro) which accidentally appear with a higher version number. See the next section for a short discussion how it ensures 'CRANapt' sorts highest. echo \"Package: *\" > /etc/apt/preferences.d/99cranapt echo \"Pin: release o=CRAN-Apt Project\" >> /etc/apt/preferences.d/99cranapt echo \"Pin: release l=CRAN-Apt Packages\" >> /etc/apt/preferences.d/99cranapt echo \"Pin-Priority: 700\" >> /etc/apt/preferences.d/99cranapt After that the package are known (under their r-cran-* and r-bioc-* names). You can install them on the command-line using apt and apt-get , via aptitude as well as other front-ends. Step 5: Use bspm (optional) Fifth, and also optional, install and enable the bspm package so that the r2u (or CRANapt) as well as other R packages (available as r-*.deb binaries) become available via install.packages() and update.packages() . Note that you may need to install it directly from source via sudo Rscript -e 'install.packages(\"bspm\")' to ensure it integrates correctly with the packaging system. You should also install Python components used internally by bspm via the sudo apt-get install python3-{dbus,gi,apt} command. apt install --yes --no-install-recommends python3-{dbus,gi,apt} ## Then install bspm (as root) and enable it, and enable a speed optimization Rscript -e 'install.packages(\"bspm\")' RHOME=$(R RHOME) echo \"suppressMessages(bspm::enable())\" >> ${RHOME}/etc/Rprofile.site echo \"options(bspm.version.check=FALSE)\" >> ${RHOME}/etc/Rprofile.site That's it! Now try it out! About Pinning Packages can be found in different repositories, and generally the highest available version is the one we what---and apt picks it for us. Now, because we let apt (and related tools) pick the packages based on versions, we may want to ensure that the CRANapt repo sorts higher than the default repo as (older) package builds in the distribution itself may appear (to apt ) to be newer via a quirk in the sorting algorithm. A case in point was package gtable whose version in Ubuntu was 0.3.0+dfsg-1 which accidentally sorts higher than the rebuild we made under a newer and more consistent version number 0.3.0-1.ca2004.1 . For this issue, one possible and popular fix is to use 'apt pinning'. It can give 'higher weight' to packages from a particular repositor or tag. In the suggested example above, we give the r2u / cranapt repo a weight of 700 which is higher than the package default value of 500. Docker There are also two Docker containers for Ubuntu 20.04 'focal' and 22.04 'jammy', respectively, at eddelbuettel/r2u that have the above, including pinning and bspm support, already set up. Note that with some builds of Docker (and possibly related to Ubuntu hosts) you may have to add the --security-opt seccomp=unconfined option to your Docker invocation to take advantage of bspm and the full system integration inside the container. This is also documented in the FAQ . Try It Use this link below (after possibly signing up for gitpod.io first) and run one of the three example scripts , or just start R in the terminal window. The gif below display running one such example to install brms from binaries in a few seconds. Using this requires only (free) GitHub and GitPod accounts. Support Please file issues at the GitHub issues for r2u . Known Issues The littler package reflects build-time configuration, the RSPM binary is then expecting a different R location so it needs a binary rebuild. Added a 'force' flag, may need a list similar to the blacklist to always compiled. A small number of packages do not build for lack required components; examples are ROracle and Rcplex. They, and their reverse dependencies, are blacklisted and not built. r2u is an apt repo, which via bspm becomes used \"automagically\" via standard R calls of install.packages() and alike. That last part is important: package installations that do not use install.packages() (such as renv , rig , ...) do not benefit from install.packages() calling apt for you, and cannot take advantage of r2u via bspm . bspm traces calls to install.packages() and maps them system-wide installation via apt . By choice, it does not map the remove.packages() for package removal, see this issue for more discussion. Packages can be uninstalled via the system package manager using, respectively, apt , dpkg or one of graphical frontends as well as via the R function bspm::remove_sys() .

We hope to eventually provide CRAN binaries for multiple distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, ...), releases (testing/stable, LTS/current, ...), hardware platforms, and so on. But we had to start somewhere, so Ubuntu LTS for amd64 is the first instance. And as we are effectively only on Ubuntu for now, the shorter 'r2u' crept up, and stuck. How is it pronounced? We think of the 'n' as silent so you can always say \"oh I just crapted these packages onto my system\". A package reports it is uninstallable Make sure you follow the 'Pinnning' section of the README.md and the setup script . Some (older) builds in the (main) Ubuntu distribution appear to sort higher and would block an installation of the freshly made binary (under a consistent naming scheme). The apt feature of 'pinning' is what we want here to have an entire repository sort higher. There can also be other issues related to CRAN allowing a hyphen in version ( e.g. nlme is currently at 3.1-157. But Debian and Ubuntu use a hyphen to split off the build iteration count so version numbers are sometimes standardised to for example 3.1.157 switching the hyphen to a dot. Sadly that leads to different sorting. (See issue #7 for more on an issue that was caused by this.) In general we can not overcome this by pinning, and we continue to try to find a more comprehensive solution that is less invasive than changing many package version numbers. What is the relationship with the c2d4u PPA ? We are huge fans of the c2d4u repository and have used it for a decade or longer. It uses the proper build process, and sits on a very solid Launchpad infrastructure supported by Canonical. However, this also makes it a little less nimble and precludes for example use of external build resources. Overall it also still at a fraction of CRAN packages. So we created this repo as an experiment to see if we could scale a simple and direct approach, and in the hopes it can complement the c2d4u PPA and offer additional packages Can I use (current) r2u with Debian? In general, it is not a good idea to mix packages from Debian and Ubuntu in the same installation. The package management system works so well for either because it generally can rely on proper package versions, dependencies, and relationships between packages. Mixing, while it may work in small isolated cases, is really not suitable to such setups. So we recommend against using (the current r2u setup which is Ubuntu-only) on Debian. (This question was also asked in issue #8 .) Can I install Bioconductor packages from Ubuntu not in r2u Ubuntu contains a number of Debian packages r-bioc-* . However, the distribution cutoff for the 'jammy' (22.04) cutoff was before Bioconductor 3.15 was released so these packages have a dependency on the 'r-api-bioc-3.14' (virtual) package. To satisfy this with our r2u packages, which are based on the newer Bioconductor 3.15, we added a small virtual package bioc-api-package that we added to the repo. So after sudo apt install bioc-api-package installation of the addional Bioconductor packages in jammy can proceed. For more details see issue #11 . Can I use it with other non-LTS Ubuntu releases? Of course! You can always forward-upgrade. So for example the 22.04 (\"jammy\") release works perfectly fine with 22.10 (\"kinetic\"). Just make sure you keep the sources.list entry on the LTS release you have as we (just like many other repositories) only provide LTS releases and no interim releases. bspm Should I install bspm? We find it helpful. It allows you to use install.packages() in R, or script install.r , and refer to CRAN and BioConductor packages by their names which is more natural. bspm will call apt for you. Hence our default Docker image has bspm installed and enabled by default. (Also see below though for docker build and bspm .) bspm is a little noisy You can wrap suppressMessages() around bspm::enable() . We now do so in the Docker image. 'Cannot connect' errors With the 22.04 \"jammy\" container I get errors We found that adding --security-opt seccomp=unconfined to the docker invocation silenced those on AWS hosts and possibly other systems. This may be related to Ubuntu hosts only. A side-effect of this required security policy statement for bspm is that bspm is not available when building containers off r2u . It appears that Docker rules this out during builds. The only remedy is to use bspm::disable() and to rely on just apt to install the r2u packages in derived containers. Can one use r2u with Singularity containers? Yes, as discussed in this GitHub issue . The key is that Singularity does not allow root access, yet we need to install packages via bspm . The best answer is this to start from the base container, add packages as needed to create a new Docker container -- and transfer / transform that container for Singularity use. The running example in that issue is installing Seurat and moderately complex and extended dependencies. Thanks to how r2u is set up a simpler Dockerfile such as FROM eddelbuettel/r2u:22.04 RUN install.r Seurat which by using install.r (from littler along with bspm turns this into a call to apt .
